# CS354R Final Project

BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS:
We built and exported our game from Unity for MacOS, meant to run on 16:9 screens.
You can play the game by simply running the exported 'BugBrawl' .app file.

GAME RULES:
The rules of the game are exactly the same as Pokemon. From the main screen,
you either press 'start' or 'exit' to enter the character select screen
or quit the game respectively. From the character select screen you must 
choose one of five characters to begin the battle with. You cannot begin 
the battle without first selecting a character. Once you've pressed the 'battle'
button, you will begin a turn based battle against a random character controlled by
the AI. After either your own or the enemy's HP is reduced to 0, you will be brought 
back to the character select screen to either choose a new character and
battle again, or exit the game.
